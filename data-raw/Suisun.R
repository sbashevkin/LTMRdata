# Fixing problems encountered non-random measuring of fish --------

## Sometimes the measured and unmeasured fish did not represent random samples from the same pool
## This would often occur when there were multiple clear size classes of a species
## In the data, this manifests as StandardLength==0 AND !is.na(CatchComments)
## StandardLength==0 represents unmeasured fish and the comments would say something like "<30mm"


# This approach assumes that if a record of an unmeasured fish has a comment, there are no other unmeasured fish in that sample of the same species without a comment.
# Currently, as of 4/15/20, this is true.
# First have to manually translate the catch comments from the below exported csv into the format of Suisun comments.xlsx, in which comments are translated
# into a minimum length, maximum length, or measured length. Some comments (like "YOY") could not be translated into lengths and will remain NAs.
# Other comments had nothing to do with length (e.g., "with eggs") and those comments are marked "ignore" to indicate we will assume they DO represent
# random samples of all catch of that species.

# filter(catch_suisun, StandardLength==0 & !is.na(CatchComments))%>%
# select(SampleRowID, Station, Date, Datetime, SampleID, TrawlComments, Taxa, Count, CatchComments)%>%
#   write_csv("~/Suisun comments.csv")

## For future updates, create the csv files as follows
# old<-read_excel(file.path("data-raw", "Suisun", "Suisun comments.xlsx"))%>%mutate(ID=paste(SampleID, Taxa, CatchComments))
# filter(catch_suisun, StandardLength==0 & !is.na(CatchComments))%>%

# filter(!ID%in%old$ID)%>%
# select(SampleRowID, Station, Date, Datetime, SampleID, TrawlComments, Taxa, Count, CatchComments)%>%
#   write_csv("~/Suisun comments.csv")

# The overall approach is to, where possible, convert these comments into Size Groups as used by Baystudy
# If we can identify the range of lengths sampled for these unmeasured lengths, we can then find all fish actually
# Measured within the same range and assign those to the same group for later calculations of adjusted size frequencies.
